## Outline {#Outline}
```{r Outline}
```
We are interested:

1. Understanding the quality of our datasets
2. Missing values
3. Dealing with Missing Values (NAs)
4. Duplicated Rows


## Data Quality

Datasets in real life are never perfect.
How to handle these real-life data quality issues?

- Missing Values
- Duplicate Rows
- Inconsistent Dates
- Impossible Values (Ex. Negative Sales)
     - Check using if conditions
     - Try outlier detection


## The 4 types of 

 1. NA  # missing 
 2. Null # undefined
 3. Inf # infinite 3/0
 4. Nan # Not a number Inf/Inf
 
## From R's Documentation
 
 ```
 NULL represents the null object in R: it is a reserved word. NULL is often returned by expressions and functions whose value is undefined.
 ```

 ```
Not Available/Missing Values
NA is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator.
 ```
 
## Missing values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5)
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)

```

## Dealing with Unavailable Values {.build}

To check if any value is NA use:
`is.na()`

is.na() can be applied to a single variable or a vector

```{r}
x <- c(3, NA, 4, 5, NA, NA)
is.na(x[2])
is.na(x)
!is.na(x)
```

## Let's try this on `airquality` dataset {.build}

Print out only those rows where Ozone is **not** NA

```{r eval=FALSE}
is.na(airquality$Ozone)
!is.na(airquality$Ozone) # prints TRUE if Ozone qty is not NA
```
Whenever that is TRUE, we want to keep the rows...

```{r eval=FALSE}
airquality[!is.na(airquality$Ozone), ]
```

## How to Convert the NA's to 0 {.build}

```{r}
tf_vector <- is.na(airquality$Solar.R)
airquality$Solar.R[tf_vector] <- 0
airquality$Solar.R
```




## How can we find `duplicated` rows? {.build}

What logic could we use to catch all the rows that repeat in our datase?

```{r}
duplicated(iris)
```
