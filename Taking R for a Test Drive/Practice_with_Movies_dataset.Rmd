# Exercise

![](images/movie_posters.jpg)

## Let's Practice with the Movies data
![](images/ggplto2.jpg)

We will use the  `movies` dataset (ggplot2movies):

```{r}
library(ggplot2movies)
# This loads the movies dataset
```

# How many rows? <br> What are the dimensions?

## {.build}

```{r}
nrow(movies)
```

```{r}
dim(movies)
```

#  Get the `head`, `tail`, <br> columns names, row names

## `head()` {.build .smaller}
```{r}
head(movies)
```

## `tail()` {.build .smaller}
```{r}
tail(movies)
```

## Column & Row Names {.build .smaller}

```{r}
names(movies)
row.names(movies)
```


##  Summarize the dataset {.build .smaller}

```{r}
summary(movies)
```


#  What can we learn just from scanning `summary(movies)`?

# About time periods? <br> Budgets? <br> Movie run times?

##  Summarize the dataset {.build .smaller}

```{r}
summary(movies$year)
summary(movies$budget)
summary(movies$length)

```
# Why is the median and the mean for `votes` so far apart?

##  Summarize the dataset {.build .smaller}
```{r}
summary(movies$votes)
```

# Look at the `mpaa` column summary

##  Summarize the dataset {.build .smaller}
```{r}
summary(movies$mpaa)
```
That is not very helpful!  

# How many types of MPAA ratings are there?

##  How many MPAA? {.build .smaller}
```{r}
unique(movies$mpaa)
```

## Which is the latest year with movies in the dataset?{.build .smaller}

```{r}
max(movies$year)
```


# Do the ratings for the 3rd movie add up to 100?

## Do the Ratings % Add up to 100? {.build .smaller}
```{r}
names(movies)
sum(movies[3, 7:16])
movies[3, 7:16]
```



## Get all the titles released in Year 2000

```{r}
condtion <- movies$year ==2000 # we can store the condition
length(movies$title[condtion])
head(movies$title[condtion])

```
 
 
## Relative percentages of the various `genres`? | What percent of all the movies are Drama, Romance etc. {.build .smaller}


```{r}
sum(movies$Romance)/nrow(movies)
mean(movies$Romance)
```

---

```{r}
mean(movies$Action)
mean(movies$Comedy)
mean(movies$Drama)
```
