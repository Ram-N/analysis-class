Ram Narasimhan

This workshop is aimed at those who are interested in **Getting Started** with Data Analysis **using R.**

It is a hands-on basic workshop for 90 minutes. There will be some instructional material presented, and small class exercises to try along with the instructions.

Weâ€™ll cover basic data structures in R, very basic data manipulating data, reading and writing datasets, and some plotting. Resources and next steps to try will also be presented.

If you already know and use R, you may not benefit from this workshop. You should consider look into the **Data Manipulation with R** or the **Visualization workshops.**
